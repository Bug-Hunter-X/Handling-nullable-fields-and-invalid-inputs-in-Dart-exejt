# Handling Nullable Fields and Invalid Input in Dart

This example demonstrates a common issue in Dart: accessing nullable fields and handling potentially invalid input.

The `MyClass` class has a nullable integer field (`_value`). The `value` getter safely handles the case where `_value` is null by providing a default value of 0 using the null-aware operator (`??`).

The `setValue` method adds validation to ensure that only non-negative values are accepted. If a negative value is provided, it throws an `ArgumentError` to indicate that the input is invalid.

This approach prevents potential null pointer exceptions and provides a more robust way to handle nullable fields and invalid user input.
